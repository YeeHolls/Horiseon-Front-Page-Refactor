HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor for Horiseon's Front Page

Challenge:
  I was asked to to refactor this starter code for Horiseon's Front Page.
  This was an on-the-job ticket that needed modifying.

  The propmt was that a marketing agency hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.


Process:
  I added in semantic HTML elements to make the code easier to read and followed a
  logical structure that fall in sequential order.
  I also refactored the CSS stylesheet to combine elements that was duplicated across the page.
  I added alt attributes to the picture elements to increase accessibility for people with disabilities.
  I also changed the title element to make it more descriptive.


  Overview:
